Introduction and advanced uses of k-mers in biodiversity genomics using modern k-mer tools and methods. 

### Summary

K-mers are a powerful tool in bioinformatics, unlocking solutions to a wide range of genomics challenges. This workshop is designed to make k-mer-based methods accessible and practical for researchers at all levels, providing the skills and knowledge needed to harness these techniques in genomics research. 

Presented by leaders in the field, participants will explore the core concepts of k-mers, learn to use essential tools, and gain insights into customising approaches for their unique research needs. With a focus on real-world applications, the workshop highlights how k-mers are particularly valuable for addressing questions in species lacking comprehensive reference genomes and annotations. Through interactive sessions utilising real-world case studies, attendees will see the transformative potential of k-mers in advancing their work.

### Target Audience

This course is suitable for anyone that works with non-model organisms that wants to gain or strengthen their ability to analyse genomic data with custom pipelines. Familiarity with command line (bash, UNIX) and previous experience with genomics data is highly recommended. 

### Learning outcomes

After attending the course participants will be able to:

- Describe the concept of k-mers and the range of their utilities
- Apply several generic k-mer tools
- Evaluate quality of sequencing runs using k-mer spectrum
- Create genome profiling models to predict genomic features
- Apply k-mer logic to custom and out of box problems

### Programme

The learning materials will cover the following topics: 

- k-mers as a concept
- how k-mers can be counted efficiently and manipulated to compare samples or species
- k-mers for QCing whole genome sequencing libraries 
- Genome profiling – estimating sequencing coverage, genome size, heterozygosity and ploidy using k-mers
- Working with k-mer indexes and graph representations of large sequencing datasets
